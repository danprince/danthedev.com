Why Would You Want Particle Effects?
- What is a Particle?
- What is a Particle Emitter?

## Implementation
The emitter is where most of the interesting programming happens, and that's where we're going to focus. But an emitter by itself isn't all that interesting. You also need code that's going to tell the emitter when to update its simulation, and if you want to see anything, you need to render the particles.
